# Option Scraper
Tracks option premium values directly from the Fidelity website. The scraping and dashboard server run locally, but that can be modified as you wish.
Clone the repo, install the relevant packages, and run OptionScraper.py from main and you're good to go!
If you want to have the scraper log in for you, modify login.json with your Fidelity username and verify the 2fa.
